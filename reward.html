<p id="t1" class="fst-italic">
Encouraging people to segregate waste into bio and non-biodegradable categories is an excellent initiative towards promoting waste management and environmental conservation. <br>The government can offer several rewards to motivate citizens to participate in this program,
including:
<br>
<br>
<b>Financial incentives</b>: The government can provide financial rewards, such as tax credits, rebates, or direct payments, to households or businesses that effectively segregate their waste. This could help reduce the financial burden on the citizens and incentivize them to participate.
<br>
<br>
<b>Recognition and appreciation</b>: The government can publicly acknowledge and recognize households or businesses that consistently segregate their waste. This could be through certificates, awards, or commendations, which could be displayed in public places such as schools, community centers, or government buildings.
<br>
<br>
<b>Access to special services</b>: The government could offer special services to households that actively segregate their waste, such as priority access to municipal services, free garbage collection services, or subsidized composting services.
<br>
<br>
<b>Education and training</b>: The government could offer education and training programs to households and businesses to encourage effective waste segregation practices. This could be done through seminars, workshops, or awareness campaigns that help citizens understand the importance of waste management and how to segregate waste correctly.
<br>
<br>
<b>Recycling initiatives</b>: The government could also create recycling initiatives that reward households or businesses that recycle their waste effectively. This could be done through a deposit return system, where people receive a small amount of money for each item they recycle, or by providing free recycling bins to households that consistently segregate their waste.
